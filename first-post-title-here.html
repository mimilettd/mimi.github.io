      <h2>Module 1 Reflections</h2>
      <h4>“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” – Frederick Douglass</h4>

      <p>Seven weeks ago, I was not a developer. If you had asked me to explain to you the difference between BubbleSort, InsertionSort, and MergeSort, I would have laughed and said “Well… let’s ask Google!” </p>

      <p>When I joined Turing in June 2017 as a Back-End Engineering student, I was a part of the 94% that came in without a formal education in Computer Science. I was a Social Science girl who enjoyed working with big data. Unfortunately, as my career developed and advanced, I started to drift away from doing what I loved (gathering and analyzing data) and started doing things I was known to be good at (people and product management).</p>

      <p>The day I realized I wanted to transition out of my current role as project manager and become a software developer was when I was looking for a cloud-based application that would produce pivot tables and agile timelines based off daily performances and was unable to find one that met my specific needs. I had then thought to myself, “I wish I could create this,” which ultimately led me to look up online programming courses. Days of research on coding boot camps, programs and extension courses led me to a post on Reddit where a Turing alumni defended untraditional pathways to programming and encouraged interested individuals to check out the <a href="https://www.turing.io/">Turing School of Software & Design.</a></p>

      <p>Intrigued, I decided to attend a <a href="http://trycoding.turing.io/"><em>Try Turing</em></a> event – a two-day program from the Turing School that aimed to expose code newbies to the basics of programming. After attending their March event, and doing some more rigorous research, I decided to apply to their back-end program. When I received my acceptance letter, and accepted a spot in their 1706 cohort (1706 stands for 2017-June cohort), I told myself that I would use the tools learned at Turing to accomplish the <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/">achievements set out by Jason Rudolph (GitHub engineer).</a></p>

      <p>Now that Module 1 is over, let me share with you what I have accomplished. Within six weeks, I have learned how to solve problems using Object-Oriented programming. I have built data structures and command-line applications using the Ruby programming language. I have taken complex problems, created algorithms to solve them, while test-driving their implementation. Furthermore, I am now able to understand fundamental Ruby syntax, decompose complex technical challenges into a series of smaller problems, build software using automated tests, pseudocode, implementation code, and refactoring, develop the skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers, and understand the culture, style, strengths, and weaknesses of working in the "tech world”. Unpersuaded? Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/mimilettd">GitHub page</a>, which has grown from zero repositories to sixteen in six short weeks.</p>

      <p>Turing has been both the best thing and hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. My most favorite technical concept learned at Turing so far has been recursion (which is a function that calls on itself). I was first introduced to recursion with <a href="http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/date_night">Date Night</a>, a project assigned out on Week 2. For this assignment, we had to create a binary search tree data structure where each “node” held a movie score and movie title. The goal was to create an algorithm that would determine how likely a given user was to enjoy a given movie that was added to the streaming service. This specific project was the epitome of struggle for me and helped me realize from very early that I had a long way to go before I would become a capable programmer.</p>

      <p>I look forward to the day in which I graduate Turing and look back at how far I’ve come. In the meantime, Module 2, I’m coming for you!</p>
